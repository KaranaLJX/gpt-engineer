Model:\n- Snake: Represents the snake in the game. It will have methods to move the snake, grow the snake, and check if the snake has collided with the walls or itself.\n- Food: Represents the food that the snake needs to eat. It will have methods to randomly place the food on the board and check if the snake has eaten the food.\n- Board: Represents the game board. It will have methods to initialize the board, update the board with the snake and food positions, and check if the snake has collided with the walls or itself.\n\n2. View:\n- GameView: Represents the game view. It will have methods to display the game board, the snake, and the food.\n\n3. Controller:\n- GameController: Represents the game controller. It will have methods to handle user input, update the game state, and check if the game is over.\n\n4. Utility:\n- Direction: Represents the direction in which the snake is moving. It will have constants for each direction (up, down, left, right).\n\nHere is the file structure for the snake game:\n\n1. main.py\n```python\nfrom controller import GameController\nfrom view import GameView\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    controller = GameController()\n    view = GameView()\n    controller.run(view)\n```\n\n2. controller.py\n```python\nfrom model import Snake, Food, Board\nfrom utility import Direction\n\nclass GameController:\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.snake = Snake()\n        self.food = Food()\n        self.board = Board()\n        self.direction = Direction.RIGHT\n\n    def run(self, view):\n        while True:\n            view.draw(self.board, self.snake, self.food)\n            self.handle_input()\n            self.update()\n            if self.is_game_over():\n                view.show_game_over()\n                break\n\n    def handle_input(self):\n        # Handle user input to change the direction of the snake\n        pass\n\n    def update(self):\n        # Update the game state by moving the snake and checking for collisions\n        pass\n\n    def is_game_over(self):\n        # Check if the game is over (snake has collided with the walls or itself)\n        pass\n```\n\n3. model.py\n```python\nfrom dataclasses import dataclass\nfrom typing import List, Tuple\nfrom utility import Direction\n\n@dataclass\nclass Snake:\n    body: List[Tuple[int, int]] = [(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0)]\n    direction: Direction = Direction.RIGHT\n\n    def move(self):\n        # Move the snake in the current direction\n        pass\n\n    def grow(self):\n        # Add a new segment to the snake's body\n        pass\n\n    def has_collided_with_wall(self):\n        # Check if the snake has collided with the walls\n        pass\n\n    def has_collided_with_self(self):\n        # Check if the snake has collided with itself\n        pass\n\n@dataclass\nclass Food:\n    position: Tuple[int, int] = (0, 0)\n\n    def place(self):\n        # Place the food at a random position on the board\n        pass\n\n    def has_been_eaten(self, snake):\n        # Check if the snake has eaten the food\n        pass\n\nclass Board:\n    def __init__(self, width=20, height=20):\n        self.width = width\n        self.height = height\n        self.grid = [[0 for _ in range(width)] for _ in range(height)]\n\n    def update(self, snake, food):\n        # Update the board with the snake and food positions\n        pass\n\n    def has_collision(self, x, y):\n        # Check if there is a collision at the given position\n        pass\n```\n\n4. view.py\n```python\nclass GameView:\n    def draw(self, board, snake, food):\n        # Draw the game board, snake, and food\n        pass\n\n    def show_game_over(self):\n        # Show the game over screen\n        pass\n```\n\n5. utility.py\n```python\nfrom enum import Enum\n\nclass Direction(Enum):\n    UP = 0\n    DOWN = 1\n    LEFT = 2\n    RIGHT = 3\n```"}]

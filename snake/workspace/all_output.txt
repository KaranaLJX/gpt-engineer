Sure, here are the core classes, functions, and methods that will be necessary for the snake game:

1. Model:
- Snake: Represents the snake in the game. It will have methods to move the snake, grow the snake, and check if the snake has collided with the walls or itself.
- Food: Represents the food that the snake needs to eat. It will have methods to randomly place the food on the board and check if the snake has eaten the food.
- Board: Represents the game board. It will have methods to initialize the board, update the board with the snake and food positions, and check if the snake has collided with the walls or itself.

2. View:
- GameView: Represents the game view. It will have methods to display the game board, the snake, and the food.

3. Controller:
- GameController: Represents the game controller. It will have methods to handle user input, update the game state, and check if the game is over.

4. Utility:
- Direction: Represents the direction in which the snake is moving. It will have constants for each direction (up, down, left, right).

Here is the file structure for the snake game:

1. main.py
```python
from controller import GameController
from view import GameView

if __name__ == '__main__':
    controller = GameController()
    view = GameView()
    controller.run(view)
```

2. controller.py
```python
from model import Snake, Food, Board
from utility import Direction

class GameController:
    def __init__(self):
        self.snake = Snake()
        self.food = Food()
        self.board = Board()
        self.direction = Direction.RIGHT

    def run(self, view):
        while True:
            view.draw(self.board, self.snake, self.food)
            self.handle_input()
            self.update()
            if self.is_game_over():
                view.show_game_over()
                break

    def handle_input(self):
        # Handle user input to change the direction of the snake
        pass

    def update(self):
        # Update the game state by moving the snake and checking for collisions
        pass

    def is_game_over(self):
        # Check if the game is over (snake has collided with the walls or itself)
        pass
```

3. model.py
```python
from dataclasses import dataclass
from typing import List, Tuple
from utility import Direction

@dataclass
class Snake:
    body: List[Tuple[int, int]] = [(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0)]
    direction: Direction = Direction.RIGHT

    def move(self):
        # Move the snake in the current direction
        pass

    def grow(self):
        # Add a new segment to the snake's body
        pass

    def has_collided_with_wall(self):
        # Check if the snake has collided with the walls
        pass

    def has_collided_with_self(self):
        # Check if the snake has collided with itself
        pass

@dataclass
class Food:
    position: Tuple[int, int] = (0, 0)

    def place(self):
        # Place the food at a random position on the board
        pass

    def has_been_eaten(self, snake):
        # Check if the snake has eaten the food
        pass

class Board:
    def __init__(self, width=20, height=20):
        self.width = width
        self.height = height
        self.grid = [[0 for _ in range(width)] for _ in range(height)]

    def update(self, snake, food):
        # Update the board with the snake and food positions
        pass

    def has_collision(self, x, y):
        # Check if there is a collision at the given position
        pass
```

4. view.py
```python
class GameView:
    def draw(self, board, snake, food):
        # Draw the game board, snake, and food
        pass

    def show_game_over(self):
        # Show the game over screen
        pass
```

5. utility.py
```python
from enum import Enum

class Direction(Enum):
    UP = 0
    DOWN = 1
    LEFT = 2
    RIGHT = 3
```
